# Insurance Fraud
All insured gear that you drop in the middle of a raid will return back to you 100% of the time regardless of trader insurance rates.

## **Overview**
This mod *somewhat* simulates insurance fraud in live EFT by ensuring that all dropped and insured gear will return back to you with 100% return rates (imagine you hid it in a bush or something).
By default, SPT insurance works through percentage rates that are set to 75% and 85% if you insure through Prapor or Therapist respectively.  This rate will still apply for all insured gear that is equipped if you die in a raid, but any other insured gear that was dropped or moved to a container outside the inventory will be affected by this mod.
